## Additional Required Steps in GitHub
1. A copy of the receipt *must* attached to your GitHub issue based on the type of reimbursement.
2. If the reimbursement is for User Group Food and Drink, the requirements on [Food and Drink](./Food-and-Drinks.md) must be met.
3. Close the GitHub issue when reimbursement has been made.
4. If the reimbursement is for something other than User Group Food and Drink, a receipt must be submitted to the Treasurer either through a [Xero expense report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-HRgqKCveFYpqSRxMjAVj-B2sNeNw3p_qK0jo4OYgU/edit?usp=sharing) if you have a Xero account, or by emailing the [Treasurer](mailto:payments@techlahoma.org) a copy of the receipt.
