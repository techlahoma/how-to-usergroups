## StarSpace46 Reservations and Meetup.com
If your user group is meeting at StarSpace46, reservations there will not be completed until your event is scheduled on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/). Include the [parking map](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57422f09ab48dec01e5e20c7/t/588fb33ee3df2828e8ceb5ab/1485814862865/ss46parking) on the meetup page. Their calendar is available at https://www.starspace46.com/calendar-1/ and their contact information is at  http://www.starspace46.com/contact.

Techlahoma doesn't have unlimited credit hours with StarSpace46, and we would like to onboard more user groups, so please limit the meetup to less than three hours. You can see the booking information in the GitHub [scheduling](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/labels/scheduling) issue. If StarSpace46 has been booked for longer than you need, please make a comment on the issue.

## Event Spaces and Entrances

### Meetups in the Holodeck
If your meetup is in the Holodeck, tell attendees to use the south door.

### Meetups in the Main Event Space
If your meetup is in the event space, tell attendees to use the west entrance instead of the south door. Before the meetup, open the west gate and watch the door for food delivery and attendees. Close the west gate and verify that the outside door is fully closed after the meetup.

## Projectors and Streaming
If you would like to use the projectors in the event space and/or have the meetup streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/techlahoma), please ask on [slack](https://techlahoma.slack.com/messages/GDG4UT8A0/) whether a volunteer is available at least one week ahead of time. 

Streaming is optional. If the content of the presentation is sensitive or presenters are uncomfortable with it (especially for lightning talks), the meetup doesn’t have to be streamed to Twitch.

### Streaming and Blue Light Reduction Tools
When streaming, make sure that the microphone is turned on, and ask presenters to turn off blue light reduction display tools like [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) as these will not look good on-stream.

## Utensils for Food and Cleanup
You don’t need to bring plates, cups, or utensils to StarSpace46. Plates and napkins are on the shelves above the kitchen sink.  If any of these supplies are missing, please mention it in [slack](https://techlahoma.slack.com/messages/GDG4UT8A0/).

Take out the trash before you leave. There is a dumpster right outside the event space's east door. Trash bags are under the sink in the kitchen.

## Starspace 46 Wi-Fi Password
