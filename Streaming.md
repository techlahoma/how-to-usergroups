We offer streaming for groups meeting at StarSpace46 in Oklahoma City. If your group meets at StarSpace46, please select a volunteer from your group who can manage streaming. The broadcast committee offers training for volunteers who would like streaming. Please email broadcasting@techlahoma.org to set up a training session.

*Please note that the broadcasting committee _cannot_ guarantee streaming if your group does not have a designated streaming volunteer.*

If you *do not meet in OKC*, please contact the broadcast committee to coordinate streaming. You may email them at broadcasting@techlahoma.org.
