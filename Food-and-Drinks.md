Starting in February 2018, all user groups approved for assistance with food and drink will receive it in the form of monetary reimbursement under the following guidelines:
* $4 per Meetup RSVP or $15 minimum (whichever is greater)
* Reimbursement requests, including a picture of the receipt, are due via GitHub or email within 1 month of the related event.
* At least 1 photo of the user group event in action is posted on Meetup event.
* The Meetup event description is accurate and gives information on the scope of the event or material covered. 
  * The title and description for the event must include the topic ("Lightning Talks" is acceptable if the description includes the topics for the talks or an explanation of what a lightning talk is). 
  * **This must be done before the meetup starts.**
* The acting treasurer will make the final call if anything is in question.
* User group leaders who are not comfortable with this arrangement may defer to the acting treasurer for other arrangements.

Process for requesting reimbursement is listed on the [reimbursement](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/wiki/Requesting-Reimbursement) wiki page.

Location Specific Notes:
* StarSpace46 - You don’t need to bring plates, cups, or utensils. Plates and napkins are on the shelves above the kitchen sink.
* 36 Degrees - There are extra plates, cups, and utensils located in the shelf labeled `Techlahoma` in the main meeting room on the far left by the sink.

If food was not requested when your user group was onboarded, you will have to wait until you submit the [user group application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdZWz8DMl95ONdr9YZl4qghLFfNZXDxwr_4P2690EAGbgl6eg/viewform?c=0&w=1) for sponsorship for the next year when the Techlahoma board reviews and approves expenses.
