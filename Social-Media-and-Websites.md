# Social Media and Websites

## Promoting StarSpace46 and Techlahoma
Announce meetup events on social media in advance. If your user group hasn't posted to Facebook or Twitter in the last couple of weeks, now would be a great time to post about the next meetup!

Be sure to promote [@Techlahoma](https://twitter.com/techlahoma) (and [@StarSpace46](https://twitter.com/StarSpace46) if applicable) in tweets.

## Group Websites
If your user group has a website, keep it updated! Make sure that the website shows the correct meetup location, especially if your group has recently changed locations.
