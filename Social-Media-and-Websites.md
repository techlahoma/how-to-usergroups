Announce meetup events on social media in advance. If your user group hasn't posted to Facebook or Twitter in the last couple of weeks, now would be a great time to post about the next meetup!

Be sure to promote [@Techlahoma](https://twitter.com/techlahoma) (and [@StarSpace46](https://twitter.com/StarSpace46) if applicable) in tweets.

If your user group has a website, keep it updated! Make sure that the website shows the correct meetup location, especially if your group has recently changed locations.
