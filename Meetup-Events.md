Techlahoma user groups, both sponsored and affiliated, are required to post their events on Meetup.com and use those events to manage RSVPs. Links to those events can be posted on other social media sites, but allowing RSVPs anywhere other than on Meetup.com is discouraged.

Creating a Meetup event triggers the user group automation. This includes creating GitHub issues and scheduling announcements. If applicable, a GitHub issue will be created for ordering [food](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/labels/food) and for reserving the [venue](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/labels/scheduling). Announcements will be scheduled using the date, time, and title of the event when it is created.

The scheduled announcements won't reflect any changes you make to the Meetup event, so it’s important to have that information correct when you first create the event.  If you don’t know what the topic will be at that point, use a generic title like `Monthly Meetup` rather than `TBD`.

When you’re looking for someone to give a presentation, try asking for volunteers in [Slack](https://techlahoma.slack.com/messages/speakers/) and on Twitter. We also have a list of available [Speakers and Topics](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/blob/master/SPEAKERS-AND-TOPICS.md).

If you need to cancel or reschedule a meetup, let Techlahoma volunteers and the venue know as soon as possible so that they can update the announcements, A/V team scheduling, and venue reservations. You can do this in a few different ways:
* Create a GitHub issue about the [scheduling](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups/labels/scheduling) change.
* Post in the [#usergroup-organizers](https://techlahoma.slack.com/messages/usergroup-organizers/) channel in Slack (and tag @avasond for StarSpace46).
* Contact Sarah at sarah@36n.co for 36°N.

As a user group leader, try to be the first from your group to arrive, ideally 15-30 minutes before the meetup starts. Identify yourself as a leader of the group when starting the meetup and introducing the speaker. Be sure to clean up after the meetup.
