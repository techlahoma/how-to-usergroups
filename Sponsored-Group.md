# Sponsored Group

We are so excited that your group is being sponsored by Techlahoma! Here are some things to know about being a part of Techlahoma, including some requirements and expectations. Feel free to book mark this repository for reference as you maintain and grow your group.  

Please note that we use [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/) for creating and managing events. Meetup allows us to carefully track the number of Oklahomans each of the groups reaches, which in turn helps us know where to focus our efforts. If you are unfamiliar with Meetup, please read our [Meetup instructions.](link)

Techlahoma sponsorship includes funding for food and drinks at your meetings. If you aren't sure what qualifies for a reimbursement, please read our [user group reimbursement page.](link)  

Techlahoma uses a [Slack channel](link) to communicate. We definitely recommend you join to meet other usergroup leaders and ask (and answer!) questions. Please specifically join the `#usergroup-organizers` channel. This is where usergroup specific announcements are made and where any questions for the user group committee can be answered. Feel free to ask questions!  

Please add your group to the appropriate folder in the [`user-groups` repository](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups) on Github. If your group is already documented, please make sure everything in up-to-date.  

### Making a Meetup

We have a few requirements for your meetup. 

- Avoid recurring events  
  We have automation in place that schedules tweets and opens issues, and recurring events don't play nicely with our automation.
  
- Schedule all meetings at least 7 days in advance  
  Please make sure the event is created on meetup *at least 7 days in advance.* There are a few reasons for this, including our automation and generally making sure space is available. It's also nice for your attendees to be able to know when and where the next meeting will be with enough planning time. Meetup automatically announces your meeting 7 days before it occurs to your members as well.

- Coordinate any streaming with the broadcasting committee  
  If you would like your meetup to be streamed, please contact the broadcasting committee to coordinate. You can ask questions in the [#ss46-ug-leaders](https://techlahoma.slack.com/messages/GDG4UT8A0/) channel in slack. (If you are not in this channel, you can request access from the usergroup committee.)

*Please note: if your meetup is not created at least 7 days in advance, **you _will not_ be able to meet at Starspace46.***

### Streaming your meetup

We offer streaming for groups meeting at Starspace46 in Oklahoma City. If your group meets at Starspace, please select a volunteer from your group who can manage streaming. The broadcast committee offers training for volunteers who would like streaming. Please email broadcasting@techlahoma.org to set up a training session.

*Please note that the broadcasting committee _cannot_ guarantee streaming if your group does not have a designated streaming volunteer.*

If you *do not meet in OKC*, please contact the broadcast committee to coordinate streaming. You may email them at broadcasting@techlahoma.org.

### Github

You will receive an invitation to join the `User Group Leaders` team on Github. *You must accept this invitation to qualify for reimbursement.*

Issues are automatically created on Github to handle food and drink reimbursement. All of the reimbursement verification is managed through Github issues. If you are unfamiliar with the reimbursement process, [please review our reimbursement how-to page.](https://github.com/techlahoma/user-group-docs/blob/master/Requesting-Reimbursement.md)

If you require an alternative to reimbursement, please contact the usergroup committee at {{ EMAIL }}.

### Starspace46

If your group plans to meet at Starspace46:

- At least two co-organizers must sign and return the [Starspace46 User Group Leader](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q1m6q4v3VrS6yVuP-tVImkNZZXG0pq_uktydbfWiovM/) agreement to Ava by 2/1.  
  You may sign the agreement and send Ava a picture of the signed agreement on Slack.
  
- Meetups must be scheduled at least one week in advance
  Starspace requires at least 7 days notice in order to use the event space. If your meetup is not scheduled at least one week in advance, Starspace46 will not be available.

### 36 Degrees North

Please contact [36 Degrees North](https://www.36degreesnorth.co/contact/) to schedule an event. Contact Luke Crouch for more details.
