### What does Techlahoma offer to user groups?
Info coming soon.

***

### May we use our own Code of Conduct (CoC) instead of the one provided by Techlahoma?
No. It is important both for insurance purposes and our UG guests that our CoC remain the same across all our groups.

***

### How do we join our new or existing user group with the Techlahoma family?
First, you'll need to fill out one of these forms:
* [New user group](http://www.techlahoma.org/usergroups/new)
* [Existing user group](http://www.techlahoma.org/usergroups/existing)

After you submit either of the above listed forms, the user group must be approved by the board committee with an 80% vote. Once you're approved, a board member or volunteer will be in touch to help get you set up.

***

### How do we order food?
Create an issue in this repo at least 24 hours in advance. Provide the following details:
* Where
* When
* Event url
* Expected RSVP total, if not available at event url.

If the food was delivered by a third party, please post a picture of the receipt to the issue thread. This is so we can track tipping but also financial data for our records.

***

### A third party delivered our grub, how should we tip?
Techlahoma will cover the gratuity up to 20%. You only need to worry about the amount if you are signing the receipt. Please post a picture of the receipt to the issue created for the food request.

***

### We no longer wish to meet on nth day of the month. How do we go about changing when we meet?
Please create an issue with the following details:
* When your group currently meets
* Where your group meets
* 3 possible day and times that you would prefer to meet.
  * Make sure none of these conflict with other Techlahoma groups.

We don't anticipate any issues in accommodating your desire to change your meeting day and times, but if you meet at one of the venues that Techlahoma coordinates with then we have to run the change by them also.

***

### Does Techlahoma own our user group once we join?
Nope. Whatever your reasons may be, you are free to distance your group from Techlahoma. Just email <info@techlahoma.org> and we'll update info. We'll miss you though!

### What do we need to do when we cancel an event?
